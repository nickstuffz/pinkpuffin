# Dolce Vita Cycling

Dolce Vita Cycling is an Elite and Development amateur cycling team based in San Francisco, CA. We develop and mentor cyclists for competition in local and national events while promoting a healthy lifestyle and personal growth through active community involvement.

# Super Sprinkles Racing

Super Sprinkles Racing exists to make cycling and racing accessible to women, transgender, femme, and other under-represented new riders in the San Francisco Bay Area.

# Thursdays.cc

Thursdays.cc is a San Francisco-based cycling collective built around performance, creativity, and community. What began as a weekly ride has grown into a culture that extends beyond the bike. More than a team, Thursdays.cc tells stories, races hard, supports each other, and rides with intention.
