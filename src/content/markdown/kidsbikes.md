# Kids' Bikes

Pink Puffin Bicycles is excited to partner with Early Rider Bicycles to offer, in our opinion, the best kids bikes available. Super light and made with the quality bits, including aluminum and birch wood frames, a belt drive drivetrain, Ritchey components, and sealed cartridge bearing hubs and headsets, these bikes will make your kid's ride easy and fun. Come in and try one out today and take a look online at their extensive selection of absolutely groundbreaking styles and designs, like their 20‚Äù wheel full suspension trail bike!
