# Custom Bikes

What is a custom bike? In part, it is the experience of choosing every piece of your bikeâ€”the design, the frame, the paint, and your dream parts. It is a memorable journey, a representation of you in bike form, and something to be savored and celebrated.

The feel of riding a bike made just for you is an experience that is almost impossible to replicate on a stock bike. This bike is measured to fit you perfectly. Every tube is made for your geometry and riding style, and then painted to match your dreams. We are all unique and individual; if you can, have your bike be unique to fit you. It will change your riding experience in ways big and small.

Seeing and riding your custom bike, the bike you helped create from your dreams, is truly a memorable experience. Let me help you design that bike and we will celebrate it together.
